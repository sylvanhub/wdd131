      <h3>Brief History of the Pearl's Touch Unisex Salon</h3>
      <p>
        The salon was founded in 2016 and the initial aim was to make hair for the students in the federal college of agriculture and the college of animal
         health and production technology. The salon specialises in barbing, dreadlock, Ghana weaving and braiding for woman, nails and eye lashes fixing,
          hair treatment and dread nursing, hair colouring, and training programs for students who want to learn the skill at an affordable
         rate. This salon was saddled with the responsibility of offering the best service at an affordable rate to the students and their lecturers.
Pearl's touch unisex salon website is built primarily for the sake of our customers. 
The website is a user-friendly environment which allow an interaction between the owner of the salon and her clients.
 The reason why people would have to come to this site is because this site would provide them with an answer to some of their questions about their hairs and how to care for it.
  Causes of razor bumps and how to permanently treat it, they can as well check for the location of the salon and book for the time of their services,
   they can as well choose the location of their service if they don’t want to come down to the salon. They can also choose from the pool of the different apprentice to make their hairs.
